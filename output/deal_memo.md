## Executive Summary

This memo presents the estimated synergy potential for the proposed acquisition of
Bolt Manufacturing by Apex Industries at an enterprise value of $500.0M.

The analysis identifies **$33.0M in total run-rate synergies**
($25.0M cost, $8.0M revenue), partially offset by
**$18.5M in one-time integration costs**. Over a 5-year
projection, the net present value of synergy cash flows is **$57.0M**
(discounted at 10%), representing **11.4% of enterprise value**.

Cumulative net cash flow turns positive in **Year 2**.

## Synergy Breakdown

### Cost Synergies — $25.0M Run-Rate

- **Procurement** — Consolidated vendor contracts across raw materials and logistics: $15.0M run-rate
- **SG&A** — Elimination of duplicate corporate functions (finance, HR, legal): $10.0M run-rate

Cost synergies follow a standard ramp-up schedule, reaching full run-rate by
Year 4.

### Revenue Synergies — $8.0M Run-Rate

- **Cross-Sell** — Cross-sell Apex specialty coatings through Bolt OEM distribution channels: $8.0M run-rate

Revenue synergies are phased more conservatively, reflecting the execution
risk inherent in cross-sell and market expansion initiatives.

## Integration Costs — $18.5M Total

- **Severance** — Severance packages for redundant corporate staff (~120 FTEs): $12.0M (Year 1)
- **IT Integration** — ERP migration from Bolt legacy system to SAP S/4HANA: $5.0M (Year 2)
- **Rebranding** — Brand consolidation and signage updates across 14 facilities: $1.5M (Year 1)

## Key Caveats

1. **Cost synergies** are generally higher-confidence than revenue synergies.
   Actual realization depends on integration execution quality and timeline.
2. **Revenue synergies** assume successful cross-sell execution and no
   material customer attrition. These are subject to higher execution risk.
3. **Integration costs** are estimated based on initial scoping; actual costs
   may vary depending on systems complexity and organizational alignment.
4. This analysis uses a **single discount rate** (10%) applied
   uniformly. A risk-adjusted approach (lower rate for cost synergies,
   higher for revenue) would provide additional precision.
5. The model does **not** include accretion/dilution analysis, tax effects,
   or financing structure impacts.
